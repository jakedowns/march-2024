| AI and Latent Space                        | Imagine your drawing app can create any picture you think of, even if you've never drawn it before. That's like AI magic using a huge imagination space to make art! | Opting Out is Okay               | It's okay if some artists don't want to share their special pictures with the magic drawing app. But it's also okay if others do and want to see what new pictures can come from it. |
| Embracing AI Tools                         | Instead of being scared of this magic drawing app, we learn to use it to make our own cool pictures even better.       | Share the Playground             | Instead of letting only the big kids (companies) decide who gets to play with what toys, everyone should get a turn to play and share.                                             |
| Blockchain for Artists                    | Think of a magic notebook that keeps track of who first thought of drawing something like a dragon with sunglasses. Whenever someone else wants to draw a similar dragon, the notebook gives a little thank you note (or even a sticker!) to the first person. | Reality Check                    | Most of us won't become super rich like in fairy tales, but we can still share and enjoy making cool stuff together.                                                                 |
| Staking Claims in Art                      | If you come up with a really cool idea for a picture, you can put a flag on it saying "I thought of this first!" Then, whenever someone else makes something like it, your flag helps you get more thank you notes or stickers. | Make Things Fair and Open        | Let's make sure everyone can see and understand how to share and make money from their creations, kind of like showing everyone the rules of a game.                                 |
| The Cycle of New Art                       | It's like when everyone starts playing with the same toy, and after a while, it gets boring, so you and your friends start looking for new toys to play with. This keeps everything fun and exciting! | Helping the Creators             | Let's make sure the people who make cool stuff get the most help and the most thank you notes or stickers, without others taking them away.                                         |
